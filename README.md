# TimesTablesPython
This piece of code makes beautiful circle patterns based on times tables circles.
So once I saw a video on YouTube named https://youtu.be/qhbuKbxJsk8 . The guy explained how these circle patterns were made. So I thought: Why not make a Python script for it? So here's it!
I used the turtle package in Python v3.4.

1. USAGE
------------------------------------
To use this script, you have to import it in your IDLE or other Python script. Then you need to mention it. See example below:

>>> import timesTablePattern                               
>>> timesTablePattern.drawTimesTable(200,51)

The first line of code imports the script, 'timesTablePattern' is the name of the script, unless you changed it by downloading it.
The second line of code draws the beautiful patterns you choose by changing the 2 taken variables by the script. The first variable assigns how many dots there are spaced out on the circle. The second variable is the multiplier, you can get beautiful patterns by changing these two variables.

For a better understanding on how this piece of code works, I suggest watching the video on YouTube: https://youtu.be/qhbuKbxJsk8
